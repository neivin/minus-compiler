---------- Building the Project ----------

To build the program, simply navigate to the directory that this README
is located in and run 'make'

Note: The program requires CUP, whose location should be added to the 
Java classpath in the Makefile. Currently, it is set to:

	CLASSPATH=-classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:.

Run 'make clean' to delete all build files.


---------- Running the Project ----------

To run the project, first build it by running 'make'.
Then, run the following command, substituting the CUP classpath for
the location of CUP on your machine:

	java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM input.cm

To print out the Abstract Syntax Tree, use the command line option -a:

	java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM -a input.cm

To print out the Symbol Table that is generated when parsing, use the
command line option -s:

	java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM -s input.cm

To generate the Assembly code, use the command line option -c:
	
	java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM -c input.cm


---------- Testing ----------

Ten test files: [1234567890].cm are included in the 'test' directory.
[1234].cm will compile properly without errors and can generate 
assembly code.

[567890].cm contain multiple syntax and semantic errors and will
not generate assembly code.

They can be executed by running the above commands from the previous
section on the test files.


---------- Acknowledgements ----------

For this checkpoint, we built upon our work from Checkpoint One and Two.

For the first checkpoint we used Professor Song's provided code 
as a starting point to build the project. We also followed the
recommended syntax tree structures for the C- language from the course
slides.
